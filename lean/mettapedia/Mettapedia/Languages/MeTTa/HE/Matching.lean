/-! ## Match Atoms and Bindings Operations

These four functions are mutually recursive (match_atoms calls merge_bindings
via add_var_binding, and merge_bindings iterates add_var_binding/add_var_equality).
We implement them as a `mutual` block with shared fuel. -/

/-! ## Checked recursion depth

These dependency programs expose one layer of the existing matcher. A coverage
check visits every recursive call that produced the answer, including empty
answers. Its stability theorem applies to all larger depths, so the caller can
distinguish completed failure from a search truncated by fuel.

/-! ## Primitive `unify` result lane

This model exposes bare aliases in the incoming record as equality constraints
before structural matcher results are merged into it. The structural cycle
filter and the ordered representative selection remain unchanged. Surviving
merged bindings are applied structurally to the success branch. This repairs
the crossed-alias representation obstruction without asserting literal-name
agreement with a different implementation's representative policy.

The caller is responsible for the final else-branch fallback when this list is
empty; upstream does that after the merge/filter pass, not before. -/

-- matchAtoms basics
example : matchAtoms (.symbol "a") (.symbol "a") 10 = [Bindings.empty] := rfl
example : matchAtoms (.symbol "a") (.symbol "b") 10 = [] := rfl
example : matchAtoms (.var "x") (.symbol "a") 10 =
    [Bindings.empty.assign "x" (.symbol "a")] := rfl

-- matchAtoms with two variables → equality
example : matchAtoms (.var "x") (.var "y") 10 =
    [Bindings.empty.addEquality "x" "y"] := rfl

-- Equality merging retains a value already attached to one endpoint.
example :
    matchAtoms
        (.expression [.symbol "g", .symbol "a", .var "q"])
        (.expression [.symbol "g", .var "p", .var "p"]) 10 =
      [{ assignments := [("p", .symbol "a")]

example :

     , equalities := [("q", "p")] } : Bindings).applyFull (.var "p") 10 =
      .symbol "a" := by
  decide

-- NEGATIVE: a later value cannot disagree with an already-valued alias.
example :
    matchAtoms
        (.expression [.symbol "g", .var "q", .symbol "A", .var "q"])
        (.expression [.symbol "g", .var "p", .var "p", .symbol "B"]) 40 = [] := by
  decide

-- NEGATIVE: equality checks values carried indirectly by both joined classes.
set_option maxRecDepth 2000 in
example :
    addVarEquality
        (((Bindings.empty.addEquality "x" "z").assign "z" (.symbol "A"))
          |>.addEquality "y" "w" |>.assign "w" (.symbol "B"))
        "x" "y" 3 = [] := by
  decide

-- POSITIVE: a consistent value can be reasserted through an alias.
example :
    addVarBinding
        ((Bindings.empty.addEquality "x" "y").assign "x" (.symbol "A"))
        "y" (.symbol "A") 10 =
