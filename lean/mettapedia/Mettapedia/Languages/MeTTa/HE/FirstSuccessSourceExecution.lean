# Scoped recursive source derivations through retained first-success execution

The admitted grammar combines independently checked closed type casts and
argument domains with recursive equation calls. Its source witnesses carry
physical query occurrences, hygienic instantiation, local matching and merging,
and binding materialization. Local leaf coverage earns a completed checked run
and completion from each saved scheduler pause. Closed type checks have
structural coverage bounds; general recursive matching retains its explicit
local coverage obligation. No whole-run completion premise is required.

Actual matching constructs independent occurrence evidence for finite
first-order patterns, including open queries and repeated variables. The record
observer retains the historical reader's equality-free normal-caller admission.
The semantic observer keeps one independently certified finite table in the
source frame and agrees with every covered checkpoint read. It admits normal
store views with bare aliases. Matching and equation updates expose those
aliases as equalities at their local merge boundary; successful reconciliation
earns the next complete certificate. One table reads every present and future
operand, while stronger output shape facts are proved for the admitted operation.

Coverage of the actual equation frontier now constructs its source evidence
for every row, including open nonlinear inputs. Each physical occurrence earns
a selected renewal and one absorption law for the complete pending tuple.
Producer and return children remain independent source derivations.

Recursive bodies retain changed bindings, selected tables and live scope.
The independent evaluator join preserves every returned atom and physical
occurrence. Its two binding comparisons are relation-list permutation and
complete solution theory with exact freshness support. The latter transports
the actual binding-machine representative through the chosen checkpoint table.
It constructs selected-source witnesses; it does not assert that every other
certified source choice is made by Rust or C, nor that literal string observers
are invariant under a residual renaming. Closed total-cast failure contributes
one error per physical type occurrence.
Mixed argument continuation laws retain changed failures without running their
tails, and preserve actual binding endpoints through the independent success
and failure histories. The earlier equation-free, read-only grammar embeds
into this one. Exact occurrence lists describe this worker's delivery policy.

The same mutual admission family covers selected-frame minimal data, successful
or genuinely unmatched unify, cons/decons, and recursive function bodies. Each
successful unify constructs its next source frame from the actual match, exposed
merge and retained structural-cycle filter. The independent match, finite model
and complete output readout are proved from those operations. Body rows
retain their own bindings and are read before the next instruction is chosen.
The ordinary embedded-call branch composes that actual invocation with its
existing typed return receiver; raw refusal and ordinary restoration remain
distinct. Emitted and completed producer provenance is explicit.

Equation admission separates actual query occurrences and materialized inputs
from emitted producer execution and typed return. Function-producing equations
run their actual bodies before the ordinary receiver resumes at each reached
frame. The ordered composition retains candidate, input and producer occurrence
coordinates; ordinary nonfunction equations are its proved specialization.

Raw eval and structural chain now reuse the same raw invocation, emitted
producer and minimal continuations. Each query retains its physical equation
occurrence and actual merge/read coverage; each chain reads the reached child
frame, substitutes its explicit binder in saved syntax, then resumes under the
original live scope and caller. Internal Empty and NotReducible are retained.
No-match refusal requires independent query absence and covered actual reads.
General polymorphic first-binding coverage, remaining minimal host operations,
and host/world effects remain separate boundaries. The full atom-application admission
still excludes embedded operator heads; the ordinary result is a call-boundary
theorem, not that additional typing coverage. Raw syntax demand holds programs
as data. No effectful host adequacy is claimed by this read-only-space worker.

/-! ## Alias-bearing caller representation boundary

The independently coherent caller below is satisfiable and loop-free. Replaying
its relations through the candidate-first executable merge adds a redundant
equality occurrence. The independent caller-first merge only inserts the fresh
assignment, so relation-list permutation cannot be a general source boundary.
No result occurrence or execution checkpoint is normalized by these controls.
