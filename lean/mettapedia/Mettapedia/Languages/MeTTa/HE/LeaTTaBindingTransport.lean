# Representation-independent HE/LeaTTa binding transport

This layer transports the faithful HE matcher and merge relations to LeaTTa's
binding interface through `LeaBindingRelEquiv`. Concrete binding-list order is not
part of the contract: the official binding set is order-free, while the two
implementations use opposite insertion conventions.

Merge and unification may return sparse or redundant presentations of one
solution.  The compositional invariant is therefore not equality of returned
relations or MGUs, but equality of the valuations satisfying their equations.
The resolver-facing global-permutation invariant below is the observable layer

/-! ### Representation-independent binding semantics

Direct equality edges, relation order, and the representative selected for an
equality class are presentations of a binding solution, not its meaning.  The
semantic interface below records exactly the two observations needed by the
equation lane:

* equality classes agree extensionally; and
* every class resolves to the same value through one global permutation of
  unresolved variables.

The *single* permutation is important.  Independent pointwise alpha witnesses
would forget sharing and could equate `[x, x]` with `[y, z]`.  Conversely, no
concrete relation list, edge set, representative chronology, or selected MGU is
part of this interface.
