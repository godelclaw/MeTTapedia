# Finite evidence for original PeTTa configurations and execution

Replay follows the existing executable `Eval.step`, whose transition
correspondence is proved against the independent declarative semantics. Exact
budget composition retains every control, continuation, store and I/O field.

Finite snapshots reconstruct the actual named-space prefix and an earned
finite cell support. Dynamic cell writes and allocation preserve that support
through the original dispatcher. Accepted raw steps and finite paths are exact
for the original recursive/effectful transition judgment on represented
configurations; every finite source path has constructed accepted evidence.

Completed public answers are observed as multisets, retaining multiplicity
without imposing a language-wide order. Internal configuration order remains
the original machine's scheduling and effect policy. Success, faults and
unfinished prefixes remain distinct. The earlier read-only reconstruction
lemmas are retained as special cases.

This is an executable-model evidence layer. Parser/native implementation
refinement, a whole Prime dialect adapter and executed resource bounds are
separate obligations.
