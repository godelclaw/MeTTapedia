# The native call table, one equation per call

`StdLib.apply` is one case analysis on the name and the arguments of a
native call. Unfolding it to evaluate a single call costs more as the table
grows, and a proof that evaluates one call by unfolding the whole table
stops working when the table gains cases.

Each equation here is the evaluation of one call shape, proved by reduction
of the table. They are simplification lemmas of high priority: a
simplification that also unfolds the table uses the equation for the call
at hand first, and never reaches the rest of the table.

The equations already stated beside the table are given the same role.
