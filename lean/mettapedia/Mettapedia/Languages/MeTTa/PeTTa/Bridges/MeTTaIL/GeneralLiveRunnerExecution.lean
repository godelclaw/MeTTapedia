# Whole runs of an admitted plan through the PeTTa driver

`gslt_live_runner.metta` runs a source term of any admitted plan step after
step. A running machine keeps the whole program observation of its state. A
tick gives every job more work and resumes it, so no search is restarted. When
the publication releases a receipt, the first released receipt is committed
whole and a new search begins at its target. A complete, empty publication ends
the run as normal; a drained job with unresolved obligations ends it as blocked;
otherwise the machine keeps running.

The model below is that machine: the generic machine of
`Mettapedia.Machines.ResumableSearchRunner` over the driver search `Spec.search`.
Its theorems hold for every number of ticks; none assumes that the source
program terminates.

- `Reached`: every machine reached from `begin` keeps the retained run of its
  current state, `programOf state k` for the work `k` done there, and a history
  whose every committed receipt is valid at the state before it;
- `History.isChain_step`: for an equation-free, stratified plan the history is a
  reduction sequence of the plan's GSLT;
- `done_no_step`: a normal ending is exact, the state has no step;
- `tick_commit_stable`: the committed receipt does not depend on how much more
  work is given; publication only grows by prefix;
- `tick_not_pending_of_saturates`, `progress`: work that covers a state's
  searches never leaves it pending, so every running machine commits or ends
  within finitely many ticks;
- `tick_commits_of_step`: for a statically admitted plan, a state with a step
  commits under such work;
- `begin_returns`, `tick_returns`, `advance_returns`, `trace_returns`: the actual
  PeTTa execution of the authored operations is this model.
