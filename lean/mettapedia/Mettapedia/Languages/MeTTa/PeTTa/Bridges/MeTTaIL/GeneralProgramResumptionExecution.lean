# Resumption and publication of program runs

A job's partial receipts grow by prefix as it works, but the program's
concatenation of partial receipts need not: more work on an earlier job can
insert receipts before those already exposed from a later job. A program run
therefore keeps every job's machine state, so that resuming adds work instead
of restarting. Its publication releases the receipts of the complete earlier
jobs, then the current receipts of the first job that is not complete, and
withholds every later job. Publication grows by prefix under every resumption,
and equals the whole readout once every job is complete.

The authored resumption continues each retained premise machine and reads its
receipts again. The authored publication reads each job's own state, never the
flat snapshot. On runs reachable from the original job starts, the actual PeTTa
execution of both is the model of this file. Resuming the driver's observation
of a job enumeration gives exactly the driver's observation of the same jobs
with the added budget.

/-! ## Retained publication delivery

The authored publication returns the whole prefix. A sequential consumer
keeps the common occurrence cursor to deliver only its new suffix. The
receipt's existing injective wire encoding supplies executable equality.
This delivery law does not grant exclusive ownership of a copied cursor or
atomic commitment of an external effect.
