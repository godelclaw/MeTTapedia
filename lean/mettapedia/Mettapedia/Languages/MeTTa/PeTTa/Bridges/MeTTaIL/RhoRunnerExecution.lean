# Running closed rho processes through the PeTTa driver

`gslt_rho_runner.metta` runs a closed rho process step by step. One step puts the state in
lexicographic canonical form, runs the depth-one COMM plan on it through the program driver, and
reads the driver's publication: the first released receipt is the next state; a complete, empty
publication means the state is quiescent; otherwise the budget was not enough.

The model below is that step. Its theorems:

- `step_sound`: a reported step is a depth-one rho step from the canonical form, which is
  structurally congruent to the process;
- `step_quiescent`: a reported quiescence means the process has no rho step at all, at any depth;
- `step_saturated`, `step_complete`: with a budget covering every job's search, a step is never
  left unsaturated, so it finds a rho step whenever the process has one;
- `run_chain`, `run_quiescent`: the run's trace is a reduction sequence modulo structural
  congruence, and it ends in quiescence only at a state with no rho step;
- `resume_search_returns`, `resume_search_completed_iff`: the authored retained-search operation
  advances the same pending program frames and prints the full updated observation;
- `Retained.commit_licenses`, `Retained.advance_add`, `Retained.two_communications`: a whole
  process keeps that search, commits the selected receipt, and resumes the successor search;
- `Retained.Reached.sound`, `Retained.Reached.chain`, `Retained.Reached.done_quiescent`: every
  execution reached by any sequence of retained operations has a chronological history of
  committed depth-one COMMs from the canonical start, its live search runs at that history's
  endpoint, and a done phase there is exact quiescence;
- `Retained.owned_publication`: under the common owned host, committed COMMs reach the world
  exactly once, copies of used tickets are refused, and the delivered history is that
  chronological COMM sequence;
- `Retained.disjoint_retained_diamond`: two disjoint closed COMMs run in either
  order through actual retained searches, retaining their receipts and a common endpoint;
- `Retained.LocatedComm.retained_realization`: occurrence-cell transactions correspond
  to the same runner, with concrete read validation, causal history interchange,
  irreversible consumption, cancellation and exactly-once owned publication;
- `cancel_returns`: the authored cancel operation returns `Retained.Execution.cancel`;
- `append_commit_returns`: chronological receipt append keeps the whole receipt;
- `begin_returns`: an empty history and a live search at matcher budget zero;
- `resume_process_returns`: a live search continues, and a finished phase stays;
- `commit_returns`: a valid completed receipt commits one canonical reduction, and a
  pending, done, or cancelled phase stays;
- `advance_returns`: quoted COMM fuel follows `Retained.Execution.advance`;
- `commit_candidate_returns`: quoted `rho:run:commit-candidate` follows
  `Retained.Execution.commitCandidate`, accepting only whole-wire receipt equality.

/-! ## Retained whole-process execution

Matcher budget stays on `Search.resume`. `advance` counts committed COMM steps.
`commit` selects the first receipt of the retained search once that search is
complete; it does not compare an externally supplied candidate. A candidate
commit uses `receiptWireEq`, the constructive `Term.decEq` test of the whole
receipt wire, so job, matcher trace, captured and completed assignments, query
history, local target and target all have to agree. Bag agreement of two
publications is not a commuting-effects theorem. The execution value itself
grants no authority: a saved copy is a fork, and committing one binding leaves
the saved binding on its search, which can commit the same receipt itself.
Exclusive authority is the common owned host's epoch ticket (`owned_publication`
below): it serves one holder, refuses copies of used tickets and delivers each
committed COMM once. `commitPublished` admits another published occurrence as an
explicit selection policy. The occurrence-cell adapter below validates local
candidates after world changes; it never relabels an old whole-process search.
Native atomicity and crash recovery remain implementation obligations.

/-! ## Reached histories

A retained execution is reached from a process by the operations of this
module: beginning, resuming the live search, committing, committing a
candidate and cancelling. Every reached execution carries a chronological
history: each commit is a valid receipt of the depth-one plan at the state
where it was committed, licenses a depth-one COMM from that state, and its
canonical result is the state of the next commit. A live search runs on the
history's endpoint; a done phase is that endpoint with a complete, empty
publication; a cancelled phase keeps the history and has no search.
