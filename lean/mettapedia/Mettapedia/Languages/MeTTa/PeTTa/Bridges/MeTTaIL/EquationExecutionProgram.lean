# Retained authored-equation operations

The optional equation source extends the rule and matcher helpers with distinct
heads. Equations remain declarations in their own list: forward and reverse
matching do not modify the directed rewrite list. The source quotation fixes
the executed bodies; adequacy of its reader remains the named source boundary.
