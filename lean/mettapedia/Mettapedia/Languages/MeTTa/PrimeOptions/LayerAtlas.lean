# An atlas of layer and feature combinations

The layers of a rewriting and knowledge-base language, from the space up, and
the features that are separately primitive, combine in some pairs and not in
others.  Each theorem below is one cell of the atlas: either a combination
with its laws, or an impossibility with an explicit counterexample together
with its repair.  Every cell is assembled from theorems proved in the module
that owns the concept.

| Cell | Verdict | Theorem |
|---|---|---|
| space × answers | one annotation algebra; MeTTa Zero is `K = ℕ` | `cell_space_answers` |
| space capabilities | meet needs a lattice, subtract a monus; no inverse of idempotent merge | `cell_space_capabilities` |
| answers × answers | commutative exactly for commutative annotations | `cell_answers_commutative` |
| answers × evidence | possibility composes without zero divisors | `cell_answers_possibility` |
| choice × probability | no distributive law; one monad with additive choice | `cell_choice_probability` |
| choice × weights × cost × state | per-answer tensor, except reads and writes | `cell_speculative_tensor` |
| answer cost × failed work | no recovery of charges before failure | `cell_cost_account_boundary` |
| absence × state | a negative read does not commute with a write | `cell_absence_state` |
| presence × concurrency | coordination free, and only monotone programs are | `cell_presence_coordination` |
| absence × concurrency | not confluent; frontier-stratified repair | `cell_absence_concurrency` |
| absence × absence | stratified joins need common strata | `cell_absence_joins` |
| consumption × concurrency | not confluent | `cell_consumption` |
| absence × cursors | gaps are the footprint; phantoms otherwise | `cell_absence_cursors` |
| absence × self-modification | frontier is a closed region | `cell_absence_selfModification` |
| absence × evidence | negative evidence only at a frontier | `cell_absence_evidence` |
| absence × failures × time | no perfect detector without a delay bound | `cell_absence_failures` |
| priority × fairness | strict priority starves; class fairness and epochs | `cell_priority_fairness` |
| reflection × authority | late binding forges; closed resolver or owned heads | `cell_reflection_authority` |
| self-modification × proof | certified installation is sound | `cell_selfModification_proofs` |
| knowledge × laziness | grounded inquiry never commits early | `cell_knowledge_laziness` |
| knowledge × observers | knowledge is an S5 interior | `cell_knowledge_observers` |
| evidence derivation | revision and conjunction are forced by samples | `cell_evidence_derivation` |
| marginal evidence × same-world conjunction | no recovery without joint information | `cell_evidence_correlation` |
| evidence × coordination | additive revision double counts; source-keyed revision does not | `cell_evidence_coordination` |
| saturation × multiplicity | bag saturation never quiesces; idempotent does | `cell_saturation_multiplicity` |
| authority × core | sealing is not eliminable | `cell_authority_primitive` |
| multiplicity × sets | counts are not recoverable from supports | `cell_multiplicity_primitive` |
| answers × possibility (exact) | possibility composes iff the annotation is positive; no ring is | `cell_possibility_positive` |
| ordered runs × answer readout | the readout is a monad morphism that forgets order and failed cost | `cell_spec_observer` |
| identified evidence × revision | additive revision exact iff disjoint; overlap by inclusion–exclusion | `cell_evidence_ledger` |
| dependent evidence × conjunction | exactly the Fréchet interval; independence is one point | `cell_evidence_dependence` |
| paired samples × confidence | the paired total is a sample size only for single samples | `cell_evidence_pairs` |
| reports × fusion | PLN's tensor is conditional-independence fusion; not conjunction | `cell_evidence_testimony` |
| negative evidence × growth | evidential negation monotone; Heyting negation not | `cell_negation_presence` |
| PLN deduction × screening off | exact under screening off; fails without it | `cell_pln_deduction` |
| absence × intuitionistic negation | frontier absence is Kripke negation; sound, incomplete for refinements | `cell_absence_intuitionistic` |
| absence × ownership | owners certify frontiers; only owners revoke | `cell_absence_ownership` |
| choice × probability × schedulers | envelopes at deterministic schedulers; pure choice is vacuous | `cell_choice_scheduler` |
| priority × overtaking | bounded overtaking bounds waiting; deadlines are aging | `cell_priority_overtaking` |
| consumption × arbitration | first commit wins; exclusive authority restores confluence | `cell_consumption_arbitration` |
| knowledge × well-founded tests | ranked programs are decided and have one implementation | `cell_knowledge_ranked` |
