# Composing transforms: when a reader may run beside a writer, when spans fuse, and what is compositional

## Pipelining and barriers

A transform writes, through a sink, what its rows make; a second transform reads the store. Run beside the
first, the reader sees the store after every prefix of the rows and keeps whatever it derives
(`pipelinedWrites`); behind a barrier it sees only the complete batch (`barrierWrites`).

* **For a monotone sink and a monotone reader the two agree**, whatever the order of the rows
  (`pipelined_eq_barrier`).
* **They agree for every store and order exactly when the reader is monotone**
  (`pipelining_safe_for_reader_iff`): an absence reader (`absentReader_not_monotone`) needs a barrier
  even behind an insertion.
* **They agree behind every monotone reader exactly when the sink is monotone**
  (`pipelining_safe_for_sink_iff`): a guarded count needs a barrier before anything reads it.

So a stratum boundary is needed exactly at a non-monotone edge: a predicate query (absence, `all`,
`unique`, a count) downstream, or a staged sink upstream.

## Fusing two rule instances

`Span.composeAlong` retains a specified counted overlap between the first output
and the second consumption. Its enabling theorem characterizes the remaining
input supplied by the original context. Each enabled overlap executes the two
spans in sequence, and every enabled sequence has such an overlap.

The maximal counted overlap supplies `Span.compose`, with identity and literal
associativity laws. These laws observe bags. They do not discard or enumerate
the finer occurrence-map witnesses of a categorical rule composition.

When the second consumes only the first production, this construction is the
previous `Span.fuse` (`Span.compose_eq_fuse`): enabled exactly when the sequence
is (`Span.fuse_enables_iff`) and reaching the same store (`Span.fuse_fire`). What the second consumes of the
first's production never reaches the store: with a full hand-off the fused span writes only the second's
production (`Span.fuse_produce_of_handoff`). This is deforestation for transforms.

## Staged sinks

A staged sink adds the rows' contributions in a commutative monoid and finalizes the sum once
(`StagedSink`). Its staging divides among workers in any way (`StagedSink.run_split`), runs as a fold in
any order (`StagedSink.run_eq_foldr`), and is what an `all` source followed by a fold computes. A
streamable sink is a staged sink through the union of writes with the identity as its finalization
(`StagedSink.ofStreamable_run`). Counts and sums stage through the natural numbers
(`StagedSink.count_run`).

## What is compositional

Bags of atoms combine by union. A reaction semantics is compositional for union when behavioural
equivalence is a congruence for it.
* **Unlabelled reactions are not compositional for a join** (`bisimilarity_not_congruence`): a lone
  `a` and the empty bag are bisimilar (neither reacts), but beside `b` the first reacts and the second
  does not.
* **Labelling each reaction with the context it borrows makes it compositional**
  (`saturated_congruence`): for every reaction relation on bags, bisimilarity of the relation
  `M —J→ N ⇔ M + J → N` is a congruence for union, and it refines unlabelled bisimilarity
  (`bisimilar_of_saturated`).
