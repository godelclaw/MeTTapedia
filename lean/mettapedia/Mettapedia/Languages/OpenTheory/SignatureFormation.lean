# Signature formation for shared HOL source terms

The raw term checker verifies applications and binding. This layer additionally
checks a constant's displayed type and a type operator's displayed arity against
an explicit declaration context.
Polymorphic occurrences supply a type-substitution certificate; its result is
checked against the declaration rather than against the occurrence's name.

Definitions retain their provenance in the registered symbol. Consequently a
different body with the same printed name is not the registered declaration.
