# Complete occurrence-sensitive COMM firings

A firing selects an input position and an output position after removing
that input. Equal messages at different positions retain different firing
addresses. The whole residue and semantic substitution result are retained,
and every public closed step has such a firing. The address space is finite
for each supplied source bag, even though the complete reaction family is
not a singleton or a finite list of ground rules.

/-! ## Retained completed-key merge and constructor composition

The producer below retains the existing byte comparator's actual packet and
emits one prepared occurrence row at a time. Its `Cursor.Fold` client appends
that row immediately to the existing constructor assembly. The independent
`List.merge` reference occurs in the representation laws, not the producer.

Completed products have exact ordered children, summary, ordinal/value
inventory and the existing pure-COMM target/public-step readout. Zero, split
and cancellation laws preserve the same representation and declared bill.
The currency counts producer polls; it is not native instructions, byte prices
or a C control-state account. Native copy-origin/ordinal decoding, ownership,
allocation/finalizers, service prices and progress bounds remain separate
obligations. No all-input termination or compiled-C refinement is inferred.
