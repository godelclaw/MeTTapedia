# The interaction kernel's commit check, against `Enabled`, `Linear` and `FormedUnder`

The interaction kernel of the Prime draft builds a commit in two phases.

* Its **walk** matches a transform's sources against the live store. Each matched source picks an
  occurrence by its position in a space, at a revision of that space, and keeps or takes it; each
  predicate query records its region and the revision it read; and every space the walk scanned is
  listed with its revision (`seen`). Code (`let`) may run between the walk and the commit.
* Its **commit** checks, at one instant, that every listed space is still at the revision the walk
  read, that every picked position still holds the atom the walk read, identification (no position
  taken twice, none both taken and kept; two keeps may share), and rights entry by entry: a take
  needs `receive`, a keep `peek`, a predicate query `observe` and a make `send`, on the handle that
  names the entry's location. Then it fires.

An `every` contributes one row per occurrence. The walk builds only rows that are linear on their
own, the amalgamation refuses rows that take a common occurrence or where one keeps what another
takes, and the whole commit, the kernel's own picks and every row, must pass identification.

This module states that check over a model of what the kernel sees (`View`: the occurrences, and
per space a revision and the occurrences in position order) and relates it to the semantic owners.

## The check, exactly (`check_iff`)

The kernel's check holds exactly when the revisions are current, the entries' rights are held, the
picked positions hold the atoms read, the makes may be sent, and the footprint the entries denote
(`decode`) is linear in the sense of the specification (`Sources.Footprint.Linear`): identification
by position is identification by occurrence (`identified_iff_linear`), because positions of one
view name distinct occurrences.

## Soundness: what the kernel accepts is enabled (`enabled_of_check`)

Suppose the walk built the footprint at a view `v₀` (every space an entry depends on was scanned,
`Scanned`), the runtime keeps the revision contract (`Tracks`: a space whose revision did not move
holds the same occurrences in the same positions), and the check passes at the commit's view `v₁`.
Then the footprint holds at `v₁` and is linear (`holds_of_check`), so every commit of it with fresh
identities is `Enabled` at `v₁` (`IsCommitOf.enabled_iff`). The revision check is a predicate query
of each scanned space (`revisionQuery_holds`), which is the one-revision protocol of
`SerializedPublication` for each space.

The revision contract cannot be dropped: a runtime that writes a space without moving its revision
passes the check for a commit that is not enabled (`Controls.untracked_write_accepted`). With both
the walk and the commit at one view the theorem applies to a real footprint
(`Controls.holder_take_passes`).

## Rights: the check is formation, entry by entry (`formedUnder_of_check`)

For a footprint whose entries are named by handles the process holds, the check implies that every
commit of the footprint is `InteractionTypes.FormedUnder` the rights those handles give
(`Controls.holder_take_formed`). The check is finer than formation under the union of held rights:
a take through a handle without `receive` is refused even when another held handle to the same
region has it (`Controls.per_handle_refused`).

## `every`: what each part checks (`identified_every_iff`)

Identification of a firing with `every` holds exactly when each row is linear on its own, the rows
are pairwise apart, the kernel's own picks are linear, and the kernel's picks are apart from every
row. The walk ensures the first and third, the amalgamation the second; only the commit's own
identification checks the fourth.

## Where the check differs from `Enabled` and from formation

* **Whole-space revisions.** Any write to a scanned space, inside the commit's regions or not, makes
  the commit stale, and so does a write undone before the commit (`Controls.stale_refused`,
  `Controls.undone_write_refused`), while the commit stays enabled. This is the price measured by
  `SerializedPublication.stale_after_any_write` and `revision_not_localTo`.
* **Linearity of the list.** A footprint that lists one take twice is refused; the commit with that
  take once is enabled (`Controls.double_take_refused`). The kernel's identification is the
  specification's `Footprint.Linear`, which `Enabled.apart` alone does not express.
* **The absence of sources bypasses `observe`.** The kernel checks `observe` for `(absent SOURCES)`
  only at the transform's own location, and each source of it for its own use (`peek` or
  `receive`). The commit it accepts is a predicate query of the sources' regions, so it is not
  formed under the process's rights when the process lacks `observe` there
  (`Controls.absence_of_sources_not_formed`). The draft binaries behave so: an absence of a read
  source on a channel, which has no `observe` facet, fires through a `peek` handle, while the
  absence written on the channel itself is refused.

## The trace the kernel prints, and the verified checker (`emit`)

The kernel prints each commit for `OccurrenceCommits.TraceChecker` (`emit`): the identities taken
and kept, the fresh identities made, each predicate query as a printed region with the identities
it matches, and what each `every` row takes. The run-by-run certificate is
`TraceChecker.checkRun_isSome_iff`; this section says what it certifies of the check above.

* **What the kernel accepts, the checker accepts** (`emit_enabledB`), for a footprint without an
  absence of sources and a printer faithful to the entries' regions (`Faithful`); and the printed
  rows pass the row test (`emit_rowsOk`).
* **The printed absence of sources is vacuous.** The kernel prints it as a region of the transform's
  location whose pattern is the source itself, which no stored atom matches; so a commit carrying it
  passes the checker at a store where the absence fails
  (`Controls.Printed.printed_absence_of_source_vacuous`). `Faithful` fails for it, and the checker
  certifies nothing about it.
* **The kernel's own picks are not printed as a row**, so a take shared by the kernel and a row
  shows only as a repeated identity, which decoding to sets merges. The checker's take test
  `TraceChecker.linearCheck` refuses it (`TraceChecker.Controls.kernel_row_double_take`); the
  kernel's own identification refuses it too (the fourth part of `identified_every_iff`).
