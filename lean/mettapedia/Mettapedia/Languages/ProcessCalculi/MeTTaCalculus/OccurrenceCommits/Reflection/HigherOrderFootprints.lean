# Footprints of transforms that install transforms

A transform's template may build a rule: `whenever` written inside a template, with variables bound
by the outer firing. When the outer transform fires, the rule is installed with those bindings. This
module answers how far static footprints reach.

## Installed rules are closures

An installed rule is a **closure**: a rule text of the program and the environment the installing
firing bound (`ClosureFires`). Its rows are the rows of the text from that environment, so bindings
flow into the rule exactly as they flow from one source to the next.

* **Every firing of every installed instance lies within the text's static footprint**
  (`closure_within_text`), whatever the environment. Static apartness of two texts makes all firings
  of all their instances independent (`closures_independent_of_staticApart`).
* **Text-closed programs** (`TextClosed`): every rule that a text's template can build decodes to a
  closure of a text of the program. Then the store never holds a rule from outside the program
  (`rulesFromTexts_fire`), and **every firing at every depth of installation lies within the static
  footprint of a program text** (`ReflectiveRun.within`). Static footprints extend to higher-order
  transforms unchanged.

## Where precision is lost, and where it comes back

* **A variable in a key position gives the key `any`** (`FootprintControls.variable_channel_any`): a listener
  installed on a channel bound by the outer firing has no static key below everything.
* **The footprint is precise at installation** (`closure_within_specialized`): once the environment
  is known, the keys of the text read through the environment (`specHeadKeys`) are sound for every
  firing of that closure (`specHeadKeys_soundFrom`, through `static_covers_from`, the static
  footprint relative to an environment). For the listener they are the channel's own key
  (`FootprintControls.listener_specialized`). Reflection with closures does not need footprints computed
  during a commit; it needs them computed when the rule is installed.

## Rules from data

When a rule is not a closure of a program text but code read from data and decoded, nothing in the
program bounds it: **every label is taken by some decodable rule** (`ground_take_rule_fires`). With a
decoding that reaches every rule text, no list of keys that misses a label bounds the rules that can be
installed (`no_static_bound_for_data_rules`). Their footprint is the static footprint of the decoded
text, computed at the installing commit, after an explicit `eval` or decode of the code.
