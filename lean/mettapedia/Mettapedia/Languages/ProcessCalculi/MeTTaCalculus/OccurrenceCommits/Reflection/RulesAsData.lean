# Rules as data: installing, uninstalling and reading rules, with exact commutation

A persistent rule (`whenever`) is an occurrence in the store, in a **rule region**, and each of its
firings keeps that occurrence. So rules are data of the one store, and the operations on rules are
ordinary commits:

* **installing** a rule makes its occurrence (`install`);
* **uninstalling** takes it (`uninstall`);
* **firing** keeps it (`FiresRule`): concurrent firings of one rule only share a kept occurrence;
* **querying the rule base** is a predicate query of the rule region (`QueriesRuleAt`); MeTTa's
  evaluator does this when it decides that no equation applies, and an `every` over rules does it
  to be complete.

## The footprint of installing, and when it commutes

`install r` takes nothing, keeps nothing, makes `r` and has no predicate query. Exactness
(`Exactness.independent_iff_both_orders`) then gives the whole answer:

* **An install commutes with a commit exactly when the commit does not query `r`'s place in the
  rule region** and does not claim the same fresh identity (`install_independent_iff`). Every
  positive commit commutes with every install (`install_commutes_of_positive`), including firings
  of other rules.
* **An install and a reader of the rule base**: the reader must come first, or be matched again
  (`ruleBase_reader_before_install`). A wave with both has a precedence edge from the reader to the
  installer.
* **Uninstalling and firing**: an uninstall spoils every firing of the rule; the firing must come
  first (`firing_before_uninstall`).
* **Installing causes firings**: a firing of `r` is never enabled before `r` is installed
  (`firing_needs_install`). This is causality, not a conflict.

## A rule added inside an `every`: a stratum question

An `every` queries its regions (its completeness queries). If its region contains the rule
region, then:

* **its own installs falsify its snapshot** (`self_install_stales_read`): a commit that makes a rule
  inside a region it queries leaves that query false at its result. The new rule fires in a
  later round, never in the round that made it;
* **another commit's install must follow it** (`ruleBase_reader_before_install`), and a commit that
  installs a rule under a predicate query of the `every`'s outputs closes a precedence cycle with it
  (`RuleControls.reflective_cycle`): no order runs both, which is the reflective form of the absence
  race. A stratified program ranks the readers of the rule base before the installs into it.
* **MeTTa's own case**: the answer route of evaluation queries the equation region (no equation
  applies), so installing an equation withdraws an inert answer
  (`RuleControls.install_withdraws_inert_answer`), the commit form of
  `MeTTaZeroTransformEvaluation.answer_not_stable_under_new_equation`.

## MM2 reflective activation

An MM2 step takes an `exec` atom and fires every match of its pattern: a transform with a take of the
`exec` atom and an `every` over the matches, whose completeness query covers the match region. Two
activations commute exactly when their takes are apart and neither makes inside the other's match
region (`Exactness`); otherwise MM2's priority order decides the outcome
(`RuleControls.mm2_order_matters`).

## Controls (compiled through `SourceCompilation`, rows computed by `decide`)

* **A rule installed mid-wave changes an `every`'s outcome** (`RuleControls.install_changes_every`): a
  meta-interpreter that fires every installed rule on every fact makes `q(a)` from one rule; once a
  second rule is installed it makes `q(a)` and `s(a)`. The commit of the first `every` is disabled by
  the install (`RuleControls.install_disables_every`): the two do not commute.
* **MM2 activations in two orders** (`RuleControls.mm2_order_matters`).
* **An uninstall counts copies** (`RuleControls.uninstall_counts_copies`): with one copy of a rule, one
  uninstall leaves no firing; with two, a firing remains. The law "a persistent rule equals two
  copies of itself" holds only for contexts that do not take rules.
