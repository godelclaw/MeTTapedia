# Controls for compiling sources to commits

Occurrences are pairs of a value and a serial number (`Occ`), labelled by their value: content
identity and occurrence identity are separate, and fresh occurrences of every label exist
(`supply`). `bagComm` declares the symbol `bag` commutative; `noComm` declares nothing, the
syntactic case. Every fact about rows below is computed by the kernel (`decide`).

## The separating cases

* **Read and take of one occurrence is refused** (`readTake_one_refused`): with one `tok`, the only
  row keeps and takes the same occurrence, the identification condition of double-pushout
  rewriting fails, and nothing fires. With two `tok`s exactly two rows are linear
  (`readTake_two_linear_rows`) and the transform fires (`readTake_two_fires`).
* **A vacuous `every` after a taking kernel** (`evalStep_vacuous`): an evaluation step takes a
  redex and, for every equation of its head, makes the right-hand side. With no equation the
  `every` has no row, and the commit takes the redex and makes nothing: the redex is lost.
  Reading one equation in the kernel first (`evalStepGuarded`) refuses the firing when there is
  none (`evalStepGuarded_refused`), and agrees with the unguarded step when there is one
  (`evalStep_with_equation`, `evalStepGuarded_with_equation`).

## Controls asked for

* **A static region that must widen modulo `E`** (`naivePrefixKeys_unsound_modulo_comm`): the
  pattern `bag(tok, $x)` has the naive prefix key `bag tok`; the label `bag(lock, tok)` is solved
  modulo commutativity and lies outside it. The consequence is concrete
  (`naive_apartness_wrong`): the naive keys declare a taker of `bag(tok, $x)` and a reader of
  `bag(lock, $y)` apart, and at a store holding `bag(lock, tok)` their commits are not
  independent. The widened keys do not declare them apart (`widened_not_apart`).
* **A non-linear pattern** (`diagonal_*`): `pr($x, $x)` matches `pr(a, a)` and not `pr(a, b)`; it
  matches `pr(bag(a, b), bag(b, a))` modulo commutativity and not syntactically. A repeated
  variable is equality modulo `E`.
* **A matcher that is sound and not complete** (`syntactic_sound_for_comm`,
  `syntactic_not_complete_for_comm`): the syntactic matcher used for the commutative theory.
  What breaks: an absence fires although the region is not empty modulo `E`
  (`incomplete_absence_fires`); an `every` misses a row and its completeness query, computed by
  the same matcher, does not see it either (`incomplete_every_misses_row`); `unique` fires with
  two occurrences in its region (`incomplete_unique_fires`). The complete matcher refuses the
  first and third and takes both rows in the second.
* **A matcher that is complete and not minimal double-counts** (`raw_not_minimal`,
  `raw_every_makes_twice`): `rawMatch` answers `bag($x, $y)` against `bag(a, a)` twice, so an
  `every` makes its template twice.
* **`every (take p)` modulo a non-unitary theory** (`everyTake_refused_modulo_comm`): an occurrence
  `bag(a, b)` has two rows for `bag($x, $y)`; both take it, and the `every` is refused, as the
  multiset `every` refuses rows that take one occurrence. Syntactically there is one row and it
  fires (`everyTake_fires_syntactic`). `all take` takes the region once in both cases
  (`allTake_fires_modulo_comm`).
* **Static independence, positive and negative** (`takeTok_readLock_apart`,
  `takeTok_readTok_not_apart`, `takeTok_readTok_dependent`).
* **The text checks for the cheapest mode** (`text_checks`, `readLock_takeTok_checks`).
