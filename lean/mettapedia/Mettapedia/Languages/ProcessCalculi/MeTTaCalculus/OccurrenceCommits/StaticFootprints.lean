# Static footprints: what a transform can touch, from its text

The footprint of a compiled commit depends on the store. A compiler, a scheduler or a type
checker needs a bound that depends only on the program text. This module computes one from the
syntax of the sources and the template, and proves that it contains every dynamic footprint.

## Region keys

A **region key** describes a set of values syntactically: a head symbol, a path prefix, a channel
name, everything. `RegionKeys` gives what a key covers (`covers`), the keys of a pattern (`keys`),
and a syntactic test that two keys cover no value in common (`apart`, proved by `apart_sound`).
The keys of a pattern are **sound for a term layer** (`RegionKeys.Sound`) when they cover every
value the pattern solves modulo `E`. This is where the theory enters: a key region that is sound
for syntactic matching need not be sound modulo `E`, and must then be widened to the closure of
the region under `E` (`CommutativeMatching` gives both cases).

## The static footprint

`SourceList.static` collects, from the text alone, the keys of what may be taken, kept, queried
and made: a take source's pattern keys go to the takes, a read source's to the keeps, the
complete sources' to the predicate queries (and with `take` to the takes), an `every` suffix adds
the keys of all its region sources as predicate queries, and the template's pattern keys go to the
makes.

* **The static footprint over-approximates every dynamic footprint** (`static_covers`): for a
  sound matcher and sound keys, everything a row takes, keeps or makes carries a label covered by
  the corresponding static keys, and the region of every predicate query of a row lies inside the
  static query keys. So per-key epochs validate every predicate query of every compiled commit
  (`CommitProtocol`'s coarse keys are this case).
* **Static apartness gives exact independence** (`independent_of_staticApart`): when the static
  footprints of two transforms are apart (take keys apart from the other's take and keep keys;
  take and make keys apart from the other's query keys), every pair of commits they fire, with
  apart fresh identities, is independent in the sense of `Exactness`. Commits of pairwise apart
  transforms have an acyclic precedence relation (`acyclic_of_pairwise_independent`): the
  "trust me" promise of `ValidationPolicies` is discharged from the text
  (`acyclic_of_staticApart`).
* **The cheapest proved check from the text** (`permits_claims_iff_of_noQueries`,
  `permits_snapshot_iff_of_noKeeps_noQueries`, `monotone_of_noTakes_noQueries`): a transform without
  complete sources and without `every` fires only positive commits, for which `claims` permits
  exactly what `serializable` does; without read sources too, `snapshot` suffices; without takes
  as well, its commits are monotone, and every mode admits the same rounds of them.
