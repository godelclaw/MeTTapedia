# Bipartite graphs and odd cycles

A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycle (Diestel, *Graph Theory*,
Proposition 1.6.1; a TODO in Mathlib's `SimpleGraph/Bipartite.lean`). The closed-walk form,
`two_colorable_iff_forall_loop_even`, is Mathlib's; the cycle form needs that every odd
closed walk contains an odd cycle.

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.Walk.exists_odd_isCycle_of_odd_length`: an odd closed walk contains an odd cycle.
* `SimpleGraph.isBipartite_iff_forall_isCycle_even`: bipartite iff every cycle has even length.
