# NavierStokes

This directory contains the Lean side of the godelclaw Navier-Stokes /
Fefferman-target route audit. It is not a proof of the Millennium
Navier-Stokes problem.

Useful entry points:

- `NavierStokesEquationTarget.lean` - concrete target surface for the
  Navier-Stokes equation on time `R` and space `R^3`.
- `FeffermanGrassrootsInterface.lean` - bridge from current approximation
  packages toward the Fefferman-style target.
- `NavierStokesWitnessConstruction.lean` - honest witness-construction surface;
  includes the zero-data witness and classifies what extra balance is needed
  for boxed steady seed routes.
- `NavierStokesBKMContinuationTarget.lean` and
  `NavierStokesUniformVorticityContinuationTarget.lean` - continuation target
  surfaces.
- `NavierStokesFiniteMode*.lean` - finite-mode classifications and obstruction
  checks.
- `WindowedColeHopfHeat*.lean` and `Fefferman*.lean` - Cole-Hopf/Fefferman
  package interfaces and obstruction/frontier surfaces.

## Cluster Map

Source-count scan from 2026-06-21:

- Cole-Hopf/Fefferman window package: 86 files. This is the largest cluster and
  includes `WindowedColeHopfHeat*`, `ColeHopf*`, and `Fefferman*` route
  surfaces.
- Finite-mode classifications and obstructions: 40 files.
- Schwartz, shear, pressure, and transported obstruction family: 28 files.
- Witness construction and shared-witness route: 16 files.
- Target/core analytic infrastructure: 9 files, including the equation target,
  vector-calculus support, Schwartz data, and energy inequality surfaces.
- BKM/continuation targets and bridges: 8 files.
- Topology countermodels: 2 files.
- Other support/frontier/regression files: the remaining files.

This map is an organizational index only. It is not evidence of global
regularity, blowup, or any other Millennium-problem conclusion.

## Current Status

The directory is best read as a route audit and obstruction library. It has
concrete theorem surfaces and some fully checked toy or boundary cases, but it
does not solve global regularity or blowup.

Current high-signal status:

- `BenH1Break.lean` refutes the original SG--Cole--Hopf H1 adjoint hypothesis
  in the normalized Fourier-mode shear model.
- The July stochastic-Lagrangian repair lane checks the conditional
  pushdown-to-BKM skeleton, dyadic absorption algebra, frozen-strain
  obstruction, and plane-wave pancake null structure.
- The live analytic pin is `ScaleLocalPancakeStrainBudget`: a pointwise,
  scale-local pancake strain budget for the self-consistent Navier-Stokes
  Biot-Savart strain. Until that is proved, the repaired route remains
  conditional.

Before moving files, keep the flat layout stable until the 4.31 stream is
settled, then prefer small import aggregators by cluster:

1. target surfaces;
2. finite-mode work;
3. Cole-Hopf/Fefferman interfaces;
4. witness-construction and obstruction regressions.

Each actual file move should be followed by import rewrites and a Lean build.
