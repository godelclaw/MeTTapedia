# Concrete source signature for Prolog text

This module instantiates the canonical `Logic.LP` representation with the
symbols and atomic values needed by a Prolog reader. Predicate and compound
symbols include their arity, matching SWI-Prolog's predicate-indicator and
functor discipline. Atoms and zero-arity compounds such as `f()` remain
distinct, as they are in modern SWI-Prolog.

Variables carry an occurrence identity in addition to their source spelling.
A reader can therefore share repeated named variables while assigning every
anonymous `_` occurrence a distinct identity before the ordinary LP
standardize-apart pass adds an activation scope.

number or string conversion. IEEE floats are stored by their 64-bit payload
so NaNs and signed zero remain distinguishable. -/

  The source reader has no constructor for this case, so a program cannot
  forge a database occurrence reference from textual syntax. -/
