# One constructor and one rewrite: hosting on terms is then the evaluator's

The rewrites of a presented language may carry premises that an evaluator
outside the language answers (`BasePremiseEvaluator`).  The probe has a rank
for every such evaluator.  This module adds to the probe one constructor of
processes and one rewrite on it whose premise is delegated,

    prime-run space subject  ⟶  prime-run space answer     if PrimeStep(space, subject, answer),

and shows what that single change does on terms.

* **For every finitely branching numbered theory there is an evaluator of
  the premises under which the extended presentation hosts it on terms**
  (`runMap_hosting`).  The theory is given by a `StepListing`: a number for
  each term and the list of the reducts of each term.  A term is read as
  `prime-run` of the numeral of its number; the evaluator
  (`stepEvaluator`) answers with the numerals of the reducts.
* **One evaluator serves a numbered family** of listed theories
  (`runPresentation_hosts_family`): the family is hosted through its union
  (`unionTheory`, `unionListing`), and the number of the member is carried
  inside the term.
* So under such an evaluator the extended presentation has reductions of
  every length and cyclic reductions (`run_steps`, `run_not_rank`).
* **Under the evaluator that answers nothing it has a rank**
  (`silentRunRank`), like the probe.
* Its contexts still have a linear size (`runLinearSize`): the change is
  about terms.

The evaluator of a listing reads its subject up to the static equivalence
(`stepAnswers_congr`).  The rule-table evaluator itself has no listing: under
a table with a rule whose right side is not determined by its left side one
term reduces to every term (`evaluatorTerms_not_listing`).  The theories given
by a table whose rules determine their right sides are listed
(`DeterminedTables`), and the rule-table evaluator is hosted by the same
presentation through an evaluator that reads the spelling of its subject
(`SpellingEvaluator`).

The hosting power on terms of a presentation with a delegated premise is the
power of its evaluator.  A hosting statement about such a candidate has to
say which evaluator it is about.
