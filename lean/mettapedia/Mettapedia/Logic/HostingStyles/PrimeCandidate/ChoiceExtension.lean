# The probe extended with choice

`NucleusDerivedModalTyping.probeWithChoice` adds to the probe a binary
constructor `prime-choose` of processes, with a rewrite to each branch, and a
constructor `prime-collect` of the sort `Alternatives`.  Its validation was
left as an evaluation there; it is proved here (`probeWithChoice_validate`),
so the extension is a presentation (`choicePresentation`) and has a generated
context theory.

What the extension changes, and what it does not:

* It generates the nondeterminism that the probe names: a choice has a
  transition to each branch (`choice_branches`).
* Its reduction still fires one rule at the root, between heads or from a
  choice to a branch (`choice_step_cases`).  It has a rank (`choiceRank`), so
  it is terminating (`choice_terminating`): the cyclic reduction of the
  rule-table evaluator has no image in it.
* The bound of three steps is gone: a tower of choices reduces in as many
  steps as it is high (`choiceTower_steps`).
* Its static equivalence is still quotation and dropping alone, so its
  contexts have a linear size (`choiceLinearSize`).
