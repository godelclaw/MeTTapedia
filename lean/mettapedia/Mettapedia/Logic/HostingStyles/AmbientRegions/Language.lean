# The ambient space with a run as a region: two presentations and one family of evaluators

The candidate with an ambient space (`ambient`) has its space outside every
term; the candidate in which atoms reduce (`atomsReduce`) has it in a run.
This module puts the run constructor of sort `Atom` into the ambient
presentation, twice, and adds no equation.

## The two presentations

Both have the twelve constructors of `atomsReduce`, the one equation of
quotation and dropping, the nine rewrites of `ambient`, the root step of a
run and the six congruences beneath a run.  They differ by what else steps
beneath a run:

* `containedRun`: beta beneath a run (`runBetaRule`), the release of a dropped
  quotation beneath a run (`runReleaseRule`), and the step of a run beneath a
  run (`runRunRule`).  None of them has a plain step of the subject as its
  premise.
* `scopedRun`: the congruence of the subject of a run (`runSubjectRule`), whose
  premise is a plain step of the subject.

`contained_scoped_common`, `contained_alone` and `scoped_alone` list the
sixteen common rewrites and the four that differ.

## The family of evaluators

`regionEvaluator admits ambientSpace` answers the premise of the ambient root
step with the answers of `ambientSpace` for the subject, and the premise of
the root step of a run with the answers of the space of the run, both read
up to the static equivalence (`admittedAnswers`).  The guard `admits` says
for which subjects it answers; `anySubject` is no guard, and then the
evaluator is the evaluator of the ambient family on the first premise and the
matching evaluator on the second (`regionEvaluator_rootPremise_any`,
`regionEvaluator_runPremise_any`).

Every member respects the static equivalence of both presentations
(`contained_respectsStatics`, `scoped_respectsStatics`), under every guard, so
each presentation with each guard is a family of presented candidates indexed
by the ambient space (`containedMember`, `scopedMember`).
