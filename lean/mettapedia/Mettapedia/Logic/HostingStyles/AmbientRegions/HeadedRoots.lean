# Root steps headed by the constructors of atoms: a third presentation

The ambient root step has a variable as left side.  Two consequences were
found: a term that is no atom has a root step, and the ambient space is asked
for a run.  A guard in the evaluator removes both and costs the weakness of
the evaluator (`guarded_not_answersByStoredRules`).

This module removes both **in the presentation**, with the evaluator
unchanged: the one ambient root step is replaced by one root step for each
constructor of atoms other than the run (`headedRoots`), each with a left side
headed by its constructor:

`AmbientStep(c(parts), answer) ⊢ c(parts) ~> answer`.

`headedContained` is the contained presentation with these eight root steps
in place of `rootRule`.  It passes the declaration gate
(`headedContained_validate`), its static equivalence is that of quotation and
dropping (`headedContained_quoteDropOnly`), and the evaluator of a region
respects it under every guard (`headedContained_respectsStatics`), so it is a
family of presented candidates indexed by the ambient space
(`headedMember`).

What a root step by one of the eight is, on patterns: `step_headedRoot`,
`headedRoot_inv`.  No left side is a variable, a bound variable or a run
(`headedRoots_shape`), so **a bound variable has no root step**: this is what
the presentation pays (`HeadedContainment`).
