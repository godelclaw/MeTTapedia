# The scoped presentation with headed root steps

In the scoped presentation the steps of a run are those by the rules of
either space at the ambient spaces that answer nothing for a run
(`scoped_run_step_iff`), and not beyond them (`scoped_run_needs_silent`): the
ambient root step has a variable as left side, and a run is an atom.

`headedScoped` is the scoped presentation with the eight root steps headed by
the constructors of atoms (`headedRoots`) in place of the ambient root step.
The root step of a run is kept: inside a run the rules of the run's space fire
on every subject.  The evaluator is the evaluator of a region, unchanged.

The presentation passes the declaration gate (`headedScoped_validate`), its
static equivalence is that of quotation and dropping
(`headedScoped_quoteDropOnly`), and every member respects it
(`headedScoped_respectsStatics`): a family of presented candidates indexed by
the ambient space (`headedScopedMember`).

* **The steps of a run are those by the rules of either space, at every
  ambient space** (`headedScoped_run_step_iff`): `run(space, subject)` steps
  to the runs of the steps of `subject` in the member at the ambient space,
  and to the runs of the steps of `subject` in the ambient presentation at
  `space`.  No hypothesis on the ambient space: no root step matches a run.
* **Every step of `headedContained` is a step of `headedScoped`**
  (`step_headedContained_headedScoped`), and `headedScoped` has a step that
  `headedContained` has not (`headedScoped_alone_steps`).  The transitions of
  a run depend on the ambient space (`headedScoped_run_depends_on_ambient`).
* **A run in a run** (`headedScoped_nested_step_iff`): the inner run sees its
  own space and the ambient space, at every ambient space; the space of the
  run around it is asked for the inner run as a whole only
  (`headedScoped_nested_ambient_seen`, `headedScoped_nested_outer_unseen`).
* **No space and no name has a transition, at every stage and under every
  evaluator** (`headedScoped_space_static`, `headedScoped_name_static`).
* **Nothing is lost for tables without a variable as a left side**
  (`headedScoped_atom_step_iff`, `headedScoped_hostOf_tabularAt`,
  `headedScoped_hostOf_scopedTabularAt`).
