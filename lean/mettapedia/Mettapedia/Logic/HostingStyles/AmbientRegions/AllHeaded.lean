# Every root step headed: a run is the member at its space, at every ambient space

`headedContained` heads the ambient root step and keeps the root step of a
run, whose subject is a variable (`headed_runRoot_unheaded`).  `allHeaded`
heads that one too: the root step of a run is replaced by one root step of a
run for each constructor of atoms other than the run (`headedRunRoots`),

`PrimeStep(space, c(parts), answer) ⊢ run(space, c(parts)) ~> run(space, answer)`.

The evaluator is the evaluator of a region, unchanged: it answers a query of
either kind for any subject pattern by one function
(`regionEvaluator_ambientQuery`, `regionEvaluator_runQuery`), and without a
guard that function answers by stored rules.  The presentation passes the
declaration gate (`allHeaded_validate`), its static equivalence is that of
quotation and dropping (`allHeaded_quoteDropOnly`), and every member respects
it (`allHeaded_respectsStatics`): a family of presented candidates indexed by
the ambient space (`allHeadedMember`).

* **The steps of a run are the runs of the steps of its subject in the member
  at the space of the run** (`allHeaded_run_step_iff`, on terms
  `allHeaded_run_termStep_iff`): under every guard, at every ambient space,
  for every space and every subject.  No hypothesis.  So for every two
  ambient spaces a run has the same steps
  (`allHeaded_run_step_ambient_irrelevant`).
* **A run in a run** (`allHeaded_nested_step_iff`): the steps of
  `run(outer, run(inner, subject))` are the runs of the runs of the steps of
  `subject` in the member at `inner`.  Neither the outer space nor the
  ambient space is in the statement, and nothing is assumed of them.
* **Two runs in one application** (`allHeaded_pair_step_iff`): a step of the
  function in the member at its space, a step of the argument in the member
  at its space, or an answer of the ambient space for the application.
* **No space and no name has a transition, at every stage and under every
  evaluator** (`allHeaded_space_static`, `allHeaded_name_static`).
* **Negative** (`allHeaded_runVariable_normal`): the run of a bound variable
  has no step; no left side matches a bound variable, in a run or outside
  one (`allHeaded_boundVariable_normal`, `headedRunRoots_not_matched_bvar`).

What the presentation hosts, its instances and what it pays are in
`AllHeadedHosting`.
