# The ambient space: one presentation, and a family of evaluators indexed by a space

The candidate in which atoms reduce (`atomsReduce`) carries its space in a
run at the root of a term.  This module writes the same candidate with the
space outside the term.

## The presentation

`ambient` has the sorts and the constructors of `atomsReduce` except the run
constructor (`ambient_terms`), its one equation, and nine rewrites
(`ambient_rewrites`):

* beta and the six congruences of application, product and abstraction, and
  the release of a dropped quotation: the rewrites of `atomsReduce` whose left
  side is no run (`ambient_keeps`);
* **one rewrite for the root step of an atom**, `rootRule`:
  `AmbientStep(subject, answer) ⊢ subject ~> answer`.  Its premise is answered
  by the evaluator.

It has no run constructor, and none of the eight rewrites of `atomsReduce`
that are about a run (`ambient_leaves`): no rewrite hands a space down.

## The family

`ambientEvaluator space` answers the premise of the root step with the
answers of `space` for the subject, both read up to the static equivalence:
it is the matching evaluator with its space fixed
(`matchingEvaluator_run_eq_ambient`).  The index is a term of the candidate
of sort `Space` (`SpaceTerm`), so the rules are data; the space is the
parameter of the evaluator and the argument of no constructor
(`space_taken_by_no_atom`).

Every member respects the static equivalence (`ambient_respectsStatics`), so
each member is a presented candidate (`ambientMember`).  At a space that
stores no atom a member answers nothing (`ambientEvaluator_of_stores_nothing`).
