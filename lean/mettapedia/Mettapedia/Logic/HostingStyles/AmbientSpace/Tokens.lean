# A constructor that the space and the subject do not mention is in no answer

`tokens counted pattern` counts the applications in a pattern whose label is
counted.  This module shows that a count that is zero stays zero through the
operations that a step of the ambient presentation is made of:

* lifting and the binder-eliminating instantiation of patterns
  (`tokens_liftBVars_eq_zero`, `tokens_instantiateBVarAt_eq_zero`), hence
  beta;
* matching a first-order pattern: the values that a match binds are parts of
  its subject (`tokens_of_matched`), and an instance of a first-order pattern
  under such bindings (`tokens_applyBindings_eq_zero`);
* reading a stored atom as a side of a rule (`tokens_asRule_eq_zero`), the
  atoms that a space stores (`tokens_of_mem_storedAtoms`), and so the answers
  of a space for a subject (`tokens_of_mem_matchResults`);
* contraction, for a count that does not count quotation and dropping
  (`tokens_contract`).

Hence **a step of a member of the family, from a pattern without a counted
constructor at a space without one, reaches a pattern without one**
(`ambient_stepAt_tokens`).  With the count of the run constructor this says
that the family never builds a run.

Typing is carried along the two inclusions of constructors that the
comparison of the two candidates needs: a term of a language is a term of a
language with more constructors (`wellSorted_of_terms_subset`), and a term
without a counted constructor is a term of the language without the counted
constructors (`wellSorted_of_tokens_eq_zero`); a term of a language none of
whose constructors is counted has none (`tokens_eq_zero_of_hasType`).
