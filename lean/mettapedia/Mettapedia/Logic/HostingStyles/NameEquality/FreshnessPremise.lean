# The test of two names as a premise

The engine of language definitions has a third way to tell two names apart:
the **freshness premise**.  With names read as free variables, the premise
"the name bound to `x` is fresh for what is bound to `y`" (`differPremise`)
holds exactly when the two names differ (`freshness_iff_differ`), so one
rewrite with that premise does the work of the family of the rules of two
different names: the engine applies it to the atom on two names exactly when
they differ (`differRewrite_fires`).  "Same" comes from the matcher, which
compares the two values of a repeated variable (`matchPattern_repeated`).  The
premise is kept by the injective renamings of the two names
(`freshness_injective_iff`), and not when two names are made one
(`freshness_examples`).

All of this is at the level of the engine: its clause for the premise, its
application of one rewrite, and the classes of evaluators.  No table of the
equality of data and no check of a certificate is built over the premise.

The matching evaluator of the candidates answers no freshness premise
(`matchingEvaluator_freshness`).  This module asks what an evaluator that
answers it keeps and what it loses, of two properties: respecting the static
equivalence (`RespectsStatics`), and answering the root step of a run by the
rules that the space stores (`AnswersByStoredRules`, the weak evaluator).

| evaluator | respects the static equivalence | weak |
|---|---|---|
| the matching evaluator | yes | yes |
| the premise read as the engine reads it (`freshnessEvaluator`) | **no**, where a rewrite has the premise (`freshnessEvaluator_not_respectsStatics`); on the candidate, which has no such rewrite, nothing changes (`freshnessEvaluator_respectsStatics_candidate`) | yes (`freshnessEvaluator_weak`) |
| the premise read through the contraction (`contractingEvaluator`) | yes (`contractingEvaluator_respectsStatics`) | yes (`contractingEvaluator_weak`) |
| the test answered at the root step of a run (`answersWithTest`) | yes (`answersWithTest_respectsStatics`) | **no** (`answersWithTest_not_weak`) |

* The engine resolves the name of the premise only when the bound value is
  written as a variable.  A name written as the quotation of its dropping is
  the same name for the static equivalence, and the premise fails on it
  (`freshness_quoted_fails`).  So the clause of the engine does not respect
  the static equivalence, and the clause that first contracts what is bound
  does.
* Either clause leaves the answers to the root step of a run as they are:
  the evaluator stays weak.  What changes is the presentation, which gets a
  rewrite with a premise (`withDifferPremise`, which passes the declaration
  gate: `withDifferPremise_validate`); a space cannot store that rewrite,
  since a stored atom is an equation without premise.
* If instead the evaluator answers the test itself at the root step of a run,
  it respects the static equivalence and is no longer weak: it answers in the
  space that stores nothing.
