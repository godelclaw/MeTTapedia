# A candidate in which atoms reduce

The candidate presentation (the probe) reduces in a sort of processes that no
constructor takes, and its header records that this contradicts the principle
*atoms reduce and data does not*.  This module writes a presentation that
follows the principle, `atomsReduce`, and names it as a presented candidate
under the matching evaluator, `atomsReduceProbe`.

## Sorts

`Atom`, `Space`, `CandidateName`.  There is no sort of processes: what
reduces is an atom.

## Constructors

| label | sort | arguments | from |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prime-unit` | `Atom` | | the probe |
| `=` | `Atom` | `Atom`, `Atom` | the probe: an equation, the form of a stored rule |
| `prime-quote` | `CandidateName` | `Atom` | the probe |
| `prime-drop` | `Atom` | `CandidateName` | the probe |
| `prime-space-empty` | `Space` | | the space extension of the probe |
| `prime-space-add` | `Space` | `Atom`, `Space` | the space extension |
| `prime-variable` | `Atom` | `Atom` | the space extension: a variable, named by an atom |
| `prime-symbol` | `Atom` | `Atom` | new: a symbol, named by an atom |
| `prime-run` | `Atom` | `Space`, `Atom` | the run constructor, here a constructor of atoms |
| `App` | `Atom` | `Atom`, `Atom` | new: expression formation, taking atoms |
| `Lam` | `Atom` | `Atom`, an atom beneath a binder | new: abstraction |
| `Pi` | `Atom` | `Atom`, an atom beneath a binder | new: product |

Left out of the probe: the sorts `Process`, `Alternatives` and
`CandidateReceipt`, and the constructors of the query and evaluation
machines, of Need requests, of dependency markers and of receipts
(`atomsReduce_leaves`).

## Equation

`prime-quote (prime-drop name) = name`, the equation of the probe.

## Rewrites

* On every atom: beta with a substitution node and the six congruences of
  application, product and abstraction (the rewrites of the language of the
  pure λΠ-calculus, `Dedukti.Language.fixedRules`); the release of a dropped
  quotation (`releaseRule`); and the congruence beneath a run
  (`runSubjectRule`).
* On a run: the root step, whose premise the evaluator answers from the space
  (`runRewrite`, the rewrite of the probe with a run constructor), and the six
  congruences beneath a run, whose premise is a step of the run of the part
  in the same space (`runAppFunctionRule` … `runLamBodyRule`).  This is how a
  part of an atom knows its space: the run constructor carries it.

There is no congruence beneath a quotation, a symbol, a variable, an equation
or a space: no left side is headed by one of them (`left_heads`), and neither
a name nor a space has a transition (`name_static`, `space_static`).

## What is proved here

* The presentation passes the declaration gate (`atomsReduce_validate`).
* Its static equivalence is that of quotation and dropping
  (`atomsReduce_quoteDropOnly`, `atomsReduce_quoteDropSorted`).
* The matching evaluator respects it (`atomsReduce_respectsStatics`), so the
  presentation under that evaluator is a presented candidate
  (`atomsReduceProbe`).
