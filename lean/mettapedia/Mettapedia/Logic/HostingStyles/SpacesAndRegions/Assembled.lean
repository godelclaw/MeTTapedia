# The candidate of spaces and regions, assembled

`assembledOver` sends a list of constructors to the presentation of spaces
and regions over them: an ambient space outside every term, the run of an
atom in a space as a contained region, and every root step headed by a
constructor of atoms and **generated from the list** (`generatedRoots`,
`generatedRunRoots`).

* `spacesAndRegions` is the presentation over the constructors of the
  candidate in which atoms reduce.  **Its rewrites are those of `allHeaded`**
  (`spacesAndRegions_rewrites`), and it is that presentation
  (`spacesAndRegions_eq_allHeaded`): what is proved of `allHeaded` is proved
  of it.
* **Over every list of constructors the generated root steps cover every
  constructor of atoms other than the run** (`assembledOver_root_step`,
  `assembledOver_runRoot_step`): an atom headed by such a constructor steps to
  every answer of the ambient space for it, and its run to the run of every
  answer of the space of the run.

## A hand-written list that misses a constructor

`constructorsWithPair` adds one constructor of atoms, the pair, to the
constructors of the candidate.  `writtenWithPair` keeps the root steps as
they were written by hand, and `generatedWithPair` is the presentation
assembled over the longer list.  Both pass the declaration gate
(`writtenWithPair_validate`, `generatedWithPair_validate`).

* The written heads no longer cover the constructors of atoms
  (`writtenWithPair_misses`); the generated root steps do
  (`generatedWithPair_covers`).
* **The step that is lost.**  At the ambient space that stores the rule
  `pair(unit, unit) = unit`, the pair of two unit atoms steps to the unit atom
  in `generatedWithPair` (`generatedWithPair_pair_steps`) and has no step in
  `writtenWithPair`, at any ambient space and under any evaluator
  (`writtenWithPair_pair_normal`).  The same holds of its run in that space
  (`generatedWithPair_runPair_steps`, `writtenWithPair_runPair_normal`).
* Nothing else differs: every step of `writtenWithPair` is a step of
  `generatedWithPair` (`generatedWithPair_keeps_written`).
