# A forced exponential tree expansion with linear DAG sharing

The fixed calculus has a base judgment `0` and one rule deriving `n+1` from
two occurrences of `n`. Every accepted proof tree of `n` therefore contains
exactly `2^(n+1)-1` nodes. A chronological DAG keeps one checked node per level
and cites the same previous node twice. This is a concrete separation of
representations for one calculus, not a separation of Frege and extended
Frege, and not merely a poor compiler's output.

The size accounts below count nodes, references and unary-encoded rule and
reference indices. No constant-time unbounded-integer assumption is needed
for the certificate-size comparison.
