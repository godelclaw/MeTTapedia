# Two negations on evidence: strong and intuitionistic

The lattice order of `BinaryEvidence` is the information order.  The same carrier has
a second order, the **truth order**: more evidence for is better and more evidence
against is worse (`TruthLE`).  Its meet and join are the evidential conjunction and
disjunction (`tmeet`, `tjoin`).  With the exchange of channels `cdNeg` as negation
and the implication `timp`, whose positive channel is the Gödel implication of the
positive channels and whose negative channel is the positive channel of the
antecedent met with the negative channel of the consequent, the carrier is the twist
structure over the chain `[0, ∞]`: the algebraic semantics of Nelson's constructive
logic with strong negation (N4, with gluts; N3 on consistent evidence).

* **Strong negation** `∼` is involutive, reverses the truth order and preserves the
  information order (`truthLE_cdNeg_iff`, `cdNeg_le_cdNeg_iff`), satisfies De Morgan's
  laws (`cdNeg_tmeet`, `cdNeg_tjoin`), and refutes an implication by its antecedent
  together with a refutation of its consequent (`cdNeg_timp`).  It is paraconsistent
  and paracomplete: `both` and its strong negation are both supported, `neither` and
  its strong negation are both unsupported (`both_and_cdNeg_supported`,
  `neither_and_cdNeg_unsupported`).
* **Intuitionistic negation** `inot a := timp a falsum` reads present absence: it is
  saturated support exactly when `a` has no support, and it is refuted by the support
  of `a` (`inot_apply`).  It obeys non-contradiction and excluded middle at the level
  of support (`not_supported_tmeet_inot`, `supported_tjoin_inot`).  Its double keeps
  only two values: some support gives `true`, none gives `false`
  (`inot_inot_apply`); `both` becomes `true` and `neither` becomes `false`
  (`inot_inot_both`, `inot_inot_neither`).  This is the closed-world reading of
  double negation, whereas the double complement of the information order keeps all
  four corners (`DoubleNegationCorners.compl_compl_eq_saturatedCorner`).
* **How the two negations relate.**  Strong negation entails intuitionistic negation
  in the truth order exactly on consistent evidence, where one channel is empty
  (`cdNeg_truthLE_inot_iff`).  Intuitionistic negation entails strong negation
  exactly when absence of support comes with saturated evidence against
  (`inot_truthLE_cdNeg_iff`), that is, when no support counts as full refutation.

* **The negative tetralemma.**  The four corners of a claim stated with strong
  negation (`corners`) all lack support, and their intuitionistic negations all have
  support, exactly when the claim has neither support nor refutation
  (`corners_unsupported_iff`, `corners_denied_iff`).

Reading.  Indian grammarians and logicians distinguish implicative negation
(*paryudāsa*), which negates a term and affirms something else in its place, from
non-implicative negation (*prasajya-pratiṣedha*), which denies without affirming
anything; on Westerhoff's reading the first keeps the presuppositions of what it
negates (choice negation) and the second can reject them (exclusion negation).
Strong negation is implicative in this sense: supporting `∼a` requires positive
evidence against `a`, as calling something non-red requires it to have some other
colour.  Intuitionistic negation is non-implicative: it is supported by the bare
absence of support.  The first entails the second on consistent evidence, and the
second entails the first exactly when absence of support guarantees refutation,
that is, when the presupposition is secured.  When it fails, all four corners are
rejected together, which is the presupposition reading of the negative tetralemma.
The present-absence reading agrees with native negation in a presheaf topos only
under a reflection condition (`GSLT.Topos.PresheafEventAbsence.absent_iff_present`),
which is the condition Dharmakīrti places on inference from non-perception: the
absent thing must be one that would have been perceived.

/-! ## The negative tetralemma

The four corners of a claim `a`, written with strong negation, are `a`, `∼a`,
`a ∧ ∼a` and `∼a ∧ ∼∼a`.  All four lack support, and the intuitionistic negations of
all four have support, exactly when `a` has neither support nor refutation.  Read
with the presupposition account of the two negations, this is the rejection of all
four corners when the claim's presupposition fails: every corner stated with the
presupposing negation is unsupported, and every corner is denied by the
non-presupposing one. -/
