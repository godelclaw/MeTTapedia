# Canonical successors of the root and occurrence search strategies

Every certified root profile is a source-level specialization of the retained
occurrence search. The comparison uses the actual publication operations of
both searches and their common presented source relation. It compares
successor classes; chronological order and derivation observations have
separate conservation contracts.
