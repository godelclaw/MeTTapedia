# Rho's depth-one step in the GSLT occurrence semantics

A canonical rho process is a sorted bag of components that are neither nil nor
parallel, so every step from it is a COMM at the root of its bag
(`CanonicalStepperCompleteness`). The plan below licenses only the root. On
closed, quotation-sealed sources whose canonically equivalent channels are
equal, its receipts are exactly the authored depth-one steps `RhoStepAt 1`:

- `receipt_step`: every valid receipt is a depth-one step with the same target;
- `step_receipt`: every depth-one step is the target of a valid receipt;
- `step_iff`: the plan's GSLT steps are the depth-one steps.

`traced_comm_inv` reads every match of the COMM left side: an input, then an
output on the same channel among the remaining components, and the residue in
order. Canonical forms (`isCanonical_channelsDecided`) and lexicographic forms
(`LexCanonical.lexCanon_channelsDecided`) decide their channels by equality, so
the literal matcher finds every pair that the rho comparator accepts. Together
with the canonical stepper theorems, a runtime that keeps processes in either
form and fires these receipts is faithful to rho modulo structural congruence.
