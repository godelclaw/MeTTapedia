# Source-selected reflective COMM and the original semantic substitution

The operation below eliminates the received binder in open ambient contexts.
On the original closed ambient domain it agrees with the existing authored
RHS readout and the paper-facing semantic substitution for every derived rho
body and payload. Received dropped names give a nonidentity family.
