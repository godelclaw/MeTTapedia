# Firing at law-normal forms

A rule fires at the law-normal form of its focus when its left side is safe for the declared
laws (`FlatSafe`), it has no premises, and its metavariable sorts are typed for the laws
(`LawFiringAdmissible`); every binder operation respects law-equality
(`binderOperation_lawSame`). The
captures are the normal forms of the original captures, and the reduct is law-equal to the
original (`rootFiring_normalize`).
