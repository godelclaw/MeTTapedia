# Source-firing coverage by prepared recursive collection matches

A source firing in a checked guard fragment supplies the ordinary matching witness.
Recursive matching at the canonical focus finds its canonical captures, and
preparation gives the ordinary replay used by the shared continuation. The
full premise history and the result's collection meaning are transported.
