# Instantiating right sides with wrapper normal captures

A right side instantiated with the captures mapped by their roles (`wrapperAssignment`) gives a result
reached from the original result by a forward chain of quote-drop and wrapper steps
(`instantiateWith?_wrapper`), when its collection rests are rests, no explicit substitution lies under a
binder, and each explicit substitution has an ordinary captured body occurring with a variable spine and
an explicit quotation as replacement (`RightShaped`), and the binder operation respects wrapper normal
bodies (`BinderRespectsWrapper`): the ordinary one always, the reflective one when its result is closed.
Below binders, where no substitution occurs, the result moves by a forward chain without any scope
condition (`instantiateWith?_plain`).
