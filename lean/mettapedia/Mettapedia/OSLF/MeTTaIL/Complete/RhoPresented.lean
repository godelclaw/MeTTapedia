# The GeneralRho.Standard.plan calculus: the canonical explorer is complete modulo its parallel laws

The GeneralRho.Standard.plan plan with its standard reduction contexts (`GeneralRho.Standard.plan`) declares the
parallel composition `PPar` as a bag that flattens, with unit `PZero`, and reduces inside parallel
compositions. Its one rule, COMM, matches a channel name twice: two presentations of the same name
may list a quoted parallel composition in different orders. The presented GSLT steps modulo the
plan's parallel laws: permutation, flattening and removal of `PZero`, in every context. The plan
declares no other equality: the name equation `@*x = x` and the identification of an empty or
singleton parallel composition with `PZero` or with its element are not among its laws, so
presentations that differ only by them are distinct states.

The plan meets every admission condition of `Complete.DescentCoherence`, so the explorer that
commits the sorted normal form explores every state reachable by steps modulo the parallel laws,
up to those laws (`rho_explores`).
