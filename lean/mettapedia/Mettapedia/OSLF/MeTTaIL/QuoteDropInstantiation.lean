# Instantiating right sides with quote-drop normal captures

A right side whose explicit substitutions put an explicit quotation into a captured body that
occurs with a variable spine (`substQuoted`, as rho's `p[@q]`) gives quote-drop equal results when
instantiated with the captures or with their normal forms (`instantiateWith?_normal`), for every
binder operation that commutes with the normal form of its body (`BinderRespects`): the ordinary
one and the reflective one (`binderRespects_ordinary`, `binderRespects_reflective`).

Captures recovered from a term whose drops are applied to names keep that property
(`matches_dropsNamed`).
