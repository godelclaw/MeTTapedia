# Retained checking of authored rewrite-recipe DAGs

Each worker call replays one original recipe node and checks its literal
premise addresses. The admitted language, binding context and result sort
remain fixed parameters. Refusal retains the old checked table and the
complete refused suffix. The table carries endpoint judgments; no rewrite
rule or search procedure is supplied by a different language.
