# Firing at wrapper normal forms

A rule fires at wrapper normal forms when it has no premises, its left side never matches a wrapper
(`wrapperFree`), its right side is shaped for wrapper normal captures (`RightShaped`), its captures are
typed at types the wrapper laws keep (`CapturesTyped`), and its binder operation is ordinary
substitution or the presentation's reflective substitution (`WrapperFiringAdmissible`). The captures at
the normal form are the original captures mapped by their roles, and the reduct reaches the new reduct
by a forward chain of quote-drop and wrapper steps (`rootFiring_wrapper`). With sites that never pass
under a binder and an empty outer scope, every firing of a plan has a counterpart at the wrapper normal
form of its source (`primitive_wrapper`).
