# Matching-to-publication coverage of retained collection occurrence work

Accepted matching allocations are installed at the same global work allowance
that publishes them. Every installed continuation retains its initialization
history. Depth-qualified source outcomes therefore reach the joint log while
matching continues. Actual receipt firings with increasing capture spines and
checked nullary or mode-parametric canonical provider queries are covered through canonical typed
context variants. Input guards require canonical finite provider rows.
Additional equation theories, outputs, quantified and child-step premises
remain separate obligations.
