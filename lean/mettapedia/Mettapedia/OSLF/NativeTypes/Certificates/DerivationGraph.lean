# Finite rule presentations on the shared derivation-graph machine

This adapter retains the existing rule inventory and every ordered premise
occurrence. It connects the generated indexed derivations and the existing
judgment-table checker to the generic chronological graph replay. It does not
identify different source calculi or confer native authority on ordinary data.
