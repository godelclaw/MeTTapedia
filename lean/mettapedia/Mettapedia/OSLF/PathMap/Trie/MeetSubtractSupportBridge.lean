# Meet/Subtract Support Bridge

Proves the extensional support-level equalities:
- `pathSupport (t₁.meet t₂) = pathSupport t₁ ∩ pathSupport t₂`
- `pathSupport (t₁.subtract t₂) = pathSupport t₁ \ pathSupport t₂`

Uses `meet_lookup` from MeetRefinement.lean and `subtract_lookup` from
SubtractRefinement.lean, bridged to `pathSupport` via helpers from
RestrictSupportBridge.lean.

## Rust Impact

These theorems give oracle tests for meet/subtract immediately:
compute `pathSupport` on both sides and compare against `∩` / `\`.

/-- **Meet support = intersection** (for sorted Unit tries).

    Positive example: `{[1,2], [3]}` meet `{[1,2], [4]}` = `{[1,2]}`
    Negative example: paths in only one trie are excluded. -/

/-! ## §3: Summary

**0 sorries. 0 axioms.**

| Theorem | What it says |
|---------|-------------|
| `pathSupport_meet_eq_inter` | meet support = lhs ∩ rhs |
| `pathSupport_subtract_eq_sdiff` | subtract support = lhs \ rhs |

Together with `RestrictSupportBridge.pathSupport_restrict_eq_restrictPaths`
and the join support theorem from UnitBridge, all four PathMap algebra
operations now have extensional support characterization.

Maps to Rust: oracle tests for meet/subtract compare `pathSupport` on
both sides against `BTreeSet::intersection` / `BTreeSet::difference`.
