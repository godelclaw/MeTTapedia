# Candidate and occurrence projections for indexed matching

A structural index must not read an internal list cell as a three-element
expression. Closed spines can be indexed through their flat reading. If a
partial or nested cell remains, offering every occurrence is complete; the
original pattern still decides unification. This projection never changes
variables or merges equal occurrences.

Sparse candidates retain their original coordinates through nested logical
views. The ordered projection is compared with `OrderedDependencyOverlay`'s
independent full-row observation, then instantiated for declarations.
