# Read certificates for pure adaptive queries

A query's next read can depend on an earlier value. Its certificate therefore
records the reads actually executed, including negative lookups when the store
value is an `Option`. Agreement on those reads suffices to replay the same
control path and obtain the same result. Values may be ordered answer lists;
no quotient by answer support or multiplicity is taken.

This is a read-only computation interface, not a binding store or a cache
replacement. Query identity, owner identity, modes and source revisions must
still distinguish different programs. Effects cannot be hidden in `pure`.
Validation compares complete values, not hash fingerprints.

An observation stays at the snapshot world where the read was performed.
A residual that has already closed over that value returns it in the original
store and in a successor store. Revalidating the cached certificate against
the successor is a different policy: `checkReads` refuses the certificate when
the observed value no longer agrees. The successor's new answer comes from
running the original query again, not from running that closed residual.
A complete positive read depends on the whole ordered list. Replacing that
list can change candidates, count, and the first element while both answers
stay nonempty, so absence versus presence does not classify the dependency.
An absence read of the same key is not agreement. A suffix extension is called
an append example only under the ordering assumption stated on
`Controls.snapshot_advance_differs_from_validated_fresh`.

/-! ## Resuming after a performed read prefix

A paused query has performed some reads in the store where it ran, and its
residual program closes over the values it saw. Resumed in another store, the
residual's later reads see that store. The resumed result is the fresh result
there whenever every performed read still agrees, absences included
(`resumed_eq_fresh_of_prefix_agrees`). A check confined to the reads the
residual has still to make does not establish this
(`Controls.pending_only_check_accepts_stale_absence`), and agreement of the
performed reads does not require an unchanged store
(`Controls.prefix_check_accepts_unrelated_change`). A residual that has already
closed over its value returns that value in either store. The successor answer
of the original query is a new run of that query, not a run of the closed
residual (`Controls.snapshot_advance_differs_from_validated_fresh`). -/

/-! ### Snapshot world versus validated-fresh

`positiveQuery` returns the complete list stored at its key, in that list's
order. Agreement is equality of the list. `Function.update positiveBefore 0
[9, 2, 2]` replaces that list. Both answers are nonempty, and the candidates,
count, and first element change. That replacement is not a physical append.

An append example needs an ordering assumption: the stored list is the
candidate sequence in admission order, and an append extends it by a suffix.
Under that assumption only, `[2, 2]` extended to `[2, 2, 9]` is an append.
The old list is a prefix, the count changes, the first element stays `2`,
and the cached certificate still fails.

`seenQuery` reads key 0 and returns it. After one step the residual is
`.pure 0`. Running that residual returns 0 in `seenBefore` and in `seenAfter`.
The answer 1 is `(run seenAfter seenQuery)`, a new run of the original query.

/-! ## Ordered candidate selection

`concatenate` is the ordered join of the lists stored at the candidate keys.
It does not run a program. `firstSuccessScan` reads until the first nonempty
list and returns that list's first occurrence. `completeScan` reads every
candidate. Occurrence identity and payload are separate fields, so two equal
payloads remain two occurrences. Candidate order is an input of the program,
not a stored value: a certificate of one order does not license another.
