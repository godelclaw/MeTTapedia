# One selected producer feeding an owned occurrence log

The composition stages an actual producer return together with its complete
post-transition residual. Capture and log admission occur before another
producer transition. A full log, a refused capture or refused admission retains
the pending return and the complete residual. Administrative progress, yields,
effect requests, handoffs, interruption and genuine completion stay distinct.
Repeated barrier notices inspect the same retained request; they execute no
host action and do not add answer occurrences.

No active consumer means no producer demand; this leaves execution and log
open rather than certifying exhaustion. Known terminal or retained request
barriers are inspected before row fullness because they execute no producer.

The scheduler below counts composition microsteps, including staging and
admission. This is different from an allowance counting admitted returns and
does not bound callback work or latency. For the owned-driver instance, the
notice projection also recovers the exact number of driver transitions and the
complete residual of the unrecorded common runner. Admission and refusal do not
execute the producer again. Capturing a borrowed return is supplied
as a primitive; its observation law is separate from native root discovery,
copy allocation and cleanup. Compatibility is checked at every producer and
buffered-delivery boundary, but the supplied check is not a proof of source
dependency validity or a transport between contexts.
The check is pure and fixed within one microstep. Revalidation after a native
callback changes its current context is an additional implementation obligation.

Retiring one consumer uses the existing log cancellation. It removes only that
consumer's unread retention. The producer residual and its accepted count, the
captured context, caller publications and every other consumer's ready answer
remain. Collection of the trimmed log is the existing ownership law; affine
discard of the whole delivery is not this transition and does not prove that
the producer effect ran once.

Ordinary execution and the notice-list runner share `pump`. `ordinary` keeps
the configuration and does not accumulate notices or test a recording policy.
`run` returns the notice list of that same configuration. Retiring a consumer
cancels that delivery cursor through the existing log operation. It is not
erasure of an optional history, and it is not how recording stops. While
another consumer still has a cursor, later slices commute with that
cancellation and do not restore the retired cursor. Retiring the last consumer
stops producer demand; the paid execution stays.

Bounded recording is the streaming runner `recordOrdinary`: one `pump`, an
immediate `Prefix.push` of that notice, and a tail-call on the updated prefix
and the next configuration. It does not build a notice list. The equality
`recordOrdinary_eq_append_run` specifies that stream as `Prefix.append` of
`run`; the unbounded runner belongs only to that proof and the laws derived
from it. The configuration remains the ordinary one. A full prefix counts
each later notice in its omitted field and does not alter the producer.
Continuing a prefix across slices keeps its remaining capacity. Dropping the
prefix and continuing with `ordinary` leaves every delivery cursor in place.
A prefix started after an ordinary slice contains only the later notices.
`enterProducerHistory` makes that choice at entry. `none` is `ordinary` and
allocates no prefix. `some record` streams `recordOrdinary` on that prefix,
keeping its items, remaining capacity and omissions.
`Mettapedia.GSLT.Core.InferenceControl.Recording.initial` supplies a fresh
capacity. A split continues the same prefix. Forgetting it continues with
`ordinary` on the recorded configuration and reaches the same complete
configuration as one ordinary run. Late recording starts
`Recording.initial` on the configuration an ordinary prefix already reached.
Both projections are projections of that complete configuration, so they
read the stored operational field of its discovered roots.

`Accounting.enterObservers` chooses history and numerical observation
independently at entry. Its four workers share `pump`; the joint worker
records and charges the same returned transition, rather than executing the
producer twice. Both projections recover the separate existing observers
and the whole operational continuation. Forgetting history keeps paid work;
starting a fresh prefix later records only the actual suffix. Pump-only
observation requires no equality decision on payloads. These numerical
coordinates count driver transitions and successful deliveries, not callback
latency, native instructions or recording expense.

An admitted log position is one admission occurrence. Each consumer delivery
of that row is a separate use, `delivery client position`, and cites that
admission. The causal graph contains only those admissions and deliveries.
A returned producer can already have advanced before capture or admission
refuses; the refusal, effect, handoff and cancellation notices keep their
own constructors and are not graph nodes.

Dropping that optional record cancels only a distinct recorder owner through
`OwnedLifecycle.closeScope` and then collects. It does not call
`ObservationOwnership.commit` or retire a consumer. Session roots are the
operational roots, the recorder, and an outside frame that has no recorder
owner. Operational roots cover the residual, the pending return, the captured
context, the current mode's retained effect or handoff request, the active
delivery cursors and the caller publications. Payload addresses come from a
declared discovery interface; agreement with compiled layout is a native
obligation. Forgetting preserves every graph reachable from the operational
roots or that frame, and reclaims a cell only outside their union. A context
cell whose only root was the recorder is reclaimed when both omit it. The
accepted execution is unchanged: collection neither refunds it nor grants a
new root.

Heap transport applies to that collected session only. It relocates cells and
owner roots; it does not rebuild residuals, pending values, context, delivery
rows or request payloads. `Relocation.roots_cancel` commutes recorder
cancellation with that image, and `Relocation.walk_collect_eq` reads ordered
paths after the projection. A relocation of the original heap is not required.
Cancelling the recorder root does not clear a strong reference stored in an
operational cell. A heap whose payload is `StoredFields` stores an operational
value, an optional observer value and both reference sets in that record.
`projectHeap` reads the operational value and the operational reference field.
`observeOperational` reads that same operational field from the source lookup
and does not consult the projected heap. `projectOptionalFields` collects the
projected heap under the supplied roots. The source heap stays readable by an
outside observer. A target that sits in both reference sets stays reachable
from the operational field. Collection reclaims an address only when it is
outside the roots and outside every operational reference set. A cell shared
with the retained outside frame keeps its stored fields on the source. The
private image is not an in-place relocation of every address.
`receiptFieldCleared` is the reference property of that projected heap. It is
not the erasure. Native layout agreement remains outside this development. The relocated session keeps the semantic
world. Ordered cells, their byte weights and alias identity are observations
of that heap.

Carrier transport is the separate map on this configuration. `State.map` sends
log values and keeps base, cursors, completion and limit. Delivery mapping
sends those rows and the publication addresses. `mapCarriers` sends the
producer, pending return, context, current effect or handoff request and that
delivery, with `mapProducer` as the producer-only case. Cursor positions and
the accepted count are copied. A pump or run crosses the map only under local
step, capture, capacity and context laws, and anchor roots agree only under
local discovery naturality. Those hypotheses are not a native layout scan.
The carrier map does not project receipt fields.

An already buffered delivery commutes with each producer microstep and with
any finite producer slice, preserving notices and the complete owned state.
A waiting read does not commute with admission of its next occurrence.
This atomic-operation law does not prove native concurrent memory access.

This construction selects one producer. It grants no equivalence with two
independently chosen computations, effectful broadcast, late subscription,
native parallel execution, or compiled-code verification.

/-! ## Carrier transport

`mapCarriers` sends the execution, pending return, captured context, current
mode request and delivery through the existing log and publication maps.
`mapProducer` remains the producer-only case. Step, capture, capacity and
context laws are local service hypotheses. Discovery naturality is local to
the supplied address extractors. Neither is a native scanner, and neither
projects receipt fields.

/-! ## Optional field projection

The stored payload is `ResourceOwnership.StoredFields`. `projectHeap` reads its
operational value and operational reference field. `observeOperational` reads
that same field from the source lookup. `projectDiscovered` collects the
projection under `anchorRoots`. Under `DiscoveryNatural`, `mapCarriers` sends
those roots to the mapped configuration. This is not an address relocation,
and a source lookup is not producer execution.

/-! ## Producer history entry

`none` runs `ordinary` and returns no prefix. `some record` streams
`recordOrdinary` on that prefix, so resumption keeps its items, remaining
capacity and omissions. Fresh capacity is
`Mettapedia.GSLT.Core.InferenceControl.Recording.initial`. `pump` does not
inspect the choice. Forgetting drops the prefix and continues with `ordinary`
from the recorded configuration. Late recording starts from
`Recording.initial` on the configuration reached by an earlier ordinary
slice. The projected heap is the projection of that complete configuration.

/-! ## Admission and delivery history

A log position names the admission of that row. Delivering the row to two
consumers creates two uses, both citing that admission. Answer readout uses
the existing event prefix. Ancestry uses the existing causal receipt.
Refusals, barriers and cancellation stay on their original constructors.

/-! ## Online production and delivery accounts

Numerical observation is independent of history retention. The ordinary entry
uses the existing uncounted runner. A requested account streams its updates
from each actual producer/delivery reply, without retaining a notice list or
building the mathematical path used in its comparison theorem. These are
protocol units: driver progress and successful consumer delivery. They do not
bound arbitrary callback work, physical instructions or external services.

/-! ### Admission and delivery causal projection

Empty direct causes discharge dependency availability only. An admission is
fresh because its position is the current row count, so it is distinct from
every earlier admission and from any captured boundary. A delivery identity is
unique because that consumer's cursor advances on the observed answer, and a
repeated publication or refusal adds no event. `CausalReceipt.Ordered` is
accumulated from those state facts. A graph label is not itself freshness or
source authority. Structural validity does not authenticate an edge or grant
execution (`valid_structure_does_not_authenticate_edges`).

The projection retains admissions and successful deliveries. It is not a
complete effect trace: `noticeAdmission?` is `some` only for `.admitted`
(`effect_request_is_not_admission`, `handoff_barrier_is_not_admission`,
`interruption_is_not_admission`). Equal stored values stay distinct occurrences
(`duplicate_payload_stays_two_deliveries`).

/-! ### Pause before the next explicit action

`pauseOnGate` is the one runner. It is a client of `enterActionObservers` for
one supplied action list. Each permitted action is one observer call. A
recorded schedule keeps the bounded `Prefix` and account returned by that call
and does not allocate a second prefix. The source policy is `fuelBeforeGate`:
fuel `0` on a nonempty schedule is exhaustion, and the gate is not read. An
empty remainder is completion. After fuel is available, `operationGate` reads
current authorization and only then the pure stop test. Authorization denial
is `ActionStop.refused`. A stop request is `ActionStop.breakpoint`. Neither
answer runs the action or changes the account. `pauseBefore` is that runner
with authorization constantly granted, so the checked Boolean client keeps
fuel-before-guard behavior. A policy that tests authorization before fuel is
a different definition and needs its own law. Native micro-transitions are
not this fuel.

`GuardInspection` is the source image of a checked or partial guard:
`matched`, `refuted`, or `incomplete`. Those names follow the native
`CettaMatchCompletion` outcomes and do not parse C or count a native budget.
`inspectionGate` reads authorization first. Its inspected pair is an
arbitrary state and proposal. The producer schedule instantiates that pair
as `Cfg` and `Action`; the decision does not execute the producer.
`matched` is a breakpoint. `refuted` is a proved false guard and permits the
action. `incomplete` retains the proposal, leaves the account unchanged, and
is neither a breakpoint, a refusal, fuel exhaustion, nor a refutation.
`operationGate` is `inspectionGate` on `booleanInspection`, so the Boolean
helper has no second runner. Replacing an incomplete decision resumes at the
retained suffix.

The result retains the configuration, the current history and account, the
consumed count, and the exact unexecuted suffix. `consumed` is a control
index. Theorem statements recover the executed word as `actions.take consumed`.
Unrecorded mode stores `history = none` and does not retain that word.
Resumption of a permitted suffix runs it once through the same observer. The
resulting equality is internal to this functional source model. It is not
native exclusive-execution authority, and copying the source record is not a
theorem that a one-shot native effect cannot run twice. A supplied
authorization predicate does not prove native rights, and this client adds no
permission framework.

`ActionStop` records only the control choice. A pending effect or handoff is
the execution mode. `execution.pending` is a borrowed return waiting for
capture. Delivery reply `.paused` is a consumer waiting for a row. None of
those is a breakpoint or a refusal, and the gate does not turn one of them
into a get-state fault. The gate is a pure test of this schedule. It is not
an equation stepper and not a C seal. The list is the chosen schedule: this
is not schedule independence and not arbitrary higher-order analyzer coverage.

/-! ## Finite credit for the actual producer and delivery cursor

The optional finite profile uses the existing shared lease ledger. Its source
program sequences existing pump/delivery actions through the common primitive
cursor. The source action account prices production and delivery separately;
it is not a bound on arbitrary callbacks or the complete native service slot.
The ordinary uncounted entry and its recording selection remain unchanged.
