# The shipped macro libraries, as exported

Each library rule appears here exactly as `cesta check-macros` reports it; the
decoding and the admission of each are decided by the kernel, and Cesta's
admission test checks that these atoms are the ones the modules currently
produce. The laws below are stated about the source use (`invoke`) of each
decoded rule and hold for the readable export of every use by
`export_correct`: the `_export` corollaries state them for the block `lower`
produces. Each rule is in the declared forms of `MacroExportComplete`
(`_forms`), so every use of it has such an export and every header definition
of it is admitted.

The caller's code is abstract: a hypothesis says what each evaluated argument
yields and how it changes the caller-visible state. Implementation facts are
hypotheses on the `Profile`: the types the written type names denote and that
`int` represents `1`.
