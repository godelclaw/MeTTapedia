# Modular translation controls on actual lambda-Pi terms

Two modules share a carrier and an imported function. Their independently
checked assignments join into a typing- and conversion-preserving translation.
Two source rewrites fuse to one target beta contraction. A separate control
uses the transcribed universe-polymorphism theory to show that forward
preservation does not imply reflection.

The upstream and sentence-style quotations below author the same operational
interface. Their interpretation is checked after quotation; no byte parser,
native certificate checker, or general inverse to the Lean encoding is claimed.
